# room-escape

Pure text version of room escape.

The game is ONLINE now!

Play it by:

    $ telnet avalonOfSunny.cloudapp.net 8080

## How to Create a Room

The rooms are defined in ./rooms folder, each in a .txt file.
All the rooms will be loaded by the game server in compiling time.

There are some already-built functions to help you define the room.
The wiki will be added later...
